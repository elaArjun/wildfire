# Wildfire Music
This is a rewrite/redesign of Wildfire Music, a free music discovery and streaming website made by [myself](http://jaredharkins.com) and [Nick Munoz](https://github.com/NickErrant) in our senior year of highschool.

The original site is still available on [neocities](http://wildfire.neocities.org).
